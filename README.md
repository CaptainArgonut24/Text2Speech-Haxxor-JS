# Text2Speech-Haxxor-JS
Extracted and modified from the source of GoAnimate Wrapper, this solution outputs text-to-speech messages as an `mp3` stream - given a voice index and message text.  Node.JS **must** be installed on the running machine.  Follows are a couple ways to utilise this solution:

## Option 1 (HTTP Request)
1. Clone/download/unzip the solution.
2. Run `launcher.bat`. It will install the needed dependency for some of the voices if not detected and THEN run Node.js, otherwise, if the dependencies are already installed, it'll just run Node.js right away.
3. Send a GET request to `http://localhost:666/tts.mp3?voice={VOICE}&text={TEXT}`, *substituting whatever is contained in the curly braces*.
4. Save the resulting `.mp3` stream to a file for playback.

## Option 2 (Execute `node`)
1. Clone/download/unzip the solution.
2. Run the solution in the command line using the following argument structure:
```console
node "{UNZIP_LOCATION}/main.js" {VOICE} {TEXT} {MP3_PATH}
```

Valid string values for the `voice` parameter can be found v√≠a table keys from `info.json`.

## Note
Most TTS providers have per-IP-address quotas.  Requests that weren't successful, regardless of cause, **will** return an *HTTP 400* error.
